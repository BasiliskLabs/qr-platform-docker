# qr-platform-docker
Very simple docker container to run qr-platform.

It is an exercise for the user to figure out how they want to get redirects.json into the docker container. If the container is local, feel free to use the Dockerfile as is, place redirects.json in the same folder as the Dockerfile and you are good to go.
